The Knight's Travails Challenge
=======================================================================================

Welcome! :) I accept two squares identified by algebraic chess notation.
The first square is the starting position and the second square is the ending position.
I will then find the shortest sequence of valid moves to take a Knight piece from the
starting position to the ending solution.

Example input would be: A8 B7
